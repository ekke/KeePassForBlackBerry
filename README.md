KeePassForBlackBerry
====================

Blackberry 10 Native Cascades port of KeePass Password Safe

This fork runs in work perimeter of BES 10
There were some problems constructing path names,
so the origin failed using BlackBerry Work Drives

This fork can be installed as internal App in BES 10 to get access to Keepass datafiles.

Lazy ? Don't want to deploy the BAR file by yourself ?
Ready-to-install binaries can be found here :)
